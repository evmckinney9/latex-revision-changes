% reviewercomments.sty
%
% This package provides functionality for highlighting text and adding margin notes corresponding
% to reviewer comments within LaTeX documents. It employs a color-coded system to distinguish
% between different reviewers' feedback, ensuring that comments and associated text modifications
% are easily visible and organized throughout the document revision process.

\ProvidesPackage{reviewercomments}

% Load required packages for color handling, margin notes, and conditional logic.
\RequirePackage{xcolor}    % Enables text coloring.
\RequirePackage{pgf}       % Used for color list processing.
\RequirePackage{todonotes} % Allows for the creation of margin notes.
\RequirePackage{etoolbox}  % Provides conditional commands and programming tools.

% Define a list of distinct colors for use in highlighting text associated with different reviewers.
% This list can be customized to include any desired colors.
\def\colorlist{{"red", "blue", "green", "orange", "purple", "brown", "cyan", "magenta", "yellow", "olive", "lime", "violet", "teal"}}
\newcounter{todocolorcounter}
\setcounter{todocolorcounter}{0} % Initialize counter for cycling through the color list.

% Set the width of the margin allocated for notes. This value may be adjusted to accommodate different document layouts or margin sizes.
\setlength{\marginparwidth}{.45in}

% Define the \reviewer command to facilitate the annotation of text with reviewer comments.
% This command enhances the document revision process by visually distinguishing feedback and
% associated text modifications.
%
% Parameters:
% - #1 (optional): showTodo, controls whether a margin note is created (default: true).
% - #2: ReviewerName, a unique identifier for the reviewer.
% - #3: CommentNumber, a unique identifier for the comment.
% - #4: CommentText, the text associated with the reviewer's comment.
%
% Usage:
% \reviewer[showTodo]{ReviewerName}{CommentNumber}{CommentText}
%
% The optional showTodo parameter allows for selective creation of margin notes, facilitating
% clear and continuous highlighting of text segments associated with the same reviewer comment,
% especially useful in cases where a comment spans multiple lines or sections with unchanged text in between.
\newcommand{\reviewer}[4][true]{%
  % Check if the reviewer's color is already defined; if not, assign a new color from the list.
  \ifcsdef{todocolor#2}{%
    \edef\reviewerColor{\csuse{todocolor#2}}% Use existing color
  }{%
    \pgfmathparse{\colorlist[\thetodocolorcounter]}% Assign new color
    \edef\reviewerColor{\pgfmathresult}%
    \csdef{todocolor#2}{\reviewerColor}%
    \stepcounter{todocolorcounter}% Increment color counter
  }%
  % Create a margin note for the first occurrence of a comment; subsequent related highlights do not generate additional notes.
  \ifstrequal{#1}{true}{%
    \todo[linecolor=\reviewerColor!50, backgroundcolor=\reviewerColor!20, size=\small]{\textbf{#2}:#3}%
  }{}%
  % Highlight the associated text with the designated color.
  \textcolor{\reviewerColor}{#4}%
